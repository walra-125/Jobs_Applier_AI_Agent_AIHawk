# AIHawk: the first Jobs Applier AI Agent


AIHawk's core architecture remains **open source**, allowing developers to inspect and extend the codebase. However, due to copyright considerations, we have removed all third‑party provider plugins from this repository.

For a fully integrated experience, including managed provider connections: check out **[laboro.co](https://laboro.co/)** an AI‑driven job board where the agent **automatically applies to jobs** for you.
